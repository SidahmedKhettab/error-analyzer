Error Analyzer is an open-source, advanced web-based platform for qualitative error analysis, annotation, and text correction. Developed within the fields of linguistics, discourse analysis, and semiotics, it is designed to support rigorous academic research. The platform enables researchers to conduct systematic investigations by comparing 'wrong' and 'corrected' texts, applying qualitative coding procedures, categorizing errors, and identifying recurrent linguistic patterns. Assisted by Google‚Äôs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Gemini AI, Error Analyzer integrates computational methods with established analytical frameworks, producing detailed reports that enhance both empirical studies and pedagogical practice. It is intended for linguists, educators, and scholars who seek not only correction but also structured analysis, theoretical insight, and reproducible research outcomes.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Intelligent Text Comparison:** Side-by-side comparison of original and corrected texts with a dynamic diff viewer to highlight changes.
-   **Advanced NLP Insights:** Utilize Google NLP to analyze Part-of-Speech (POS) tags, dependencies, entities, tense, number, and surface edits, providing quantitative linguistic insights.
-   **Gemini AI Integration:** Engage with an AI chat assistant for deeper analysis, context-aware explanations, and automated tagging suggestions.
-   **Flexible Tagging & Annotation:** Manually tag and annotate specific errors or linguistic phenomena within texts.
-   **Comprehensive Notes Management:** Create and manage detailed notes associated with text pairs for qualitative analysis.
-   **Dynamic Tag Reporting:** Generate visual reports and charts (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, volcano plots) based on your tags and NLP data, offering actionable insights into error patterns.
-   **Project Management:** Easily create, edit, delete, import, and export projects, maintaining a structured workflow for your analysis tasks.
-   **Multi-language Support:** Seamlessly switch between English and French interfaces for broader accessibility.
-   **Secure User Authentication:** Protect your projects with robust user login and project access control.

## üöÄ Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
> - If you‚Äôre on Windows and don‚Äôt have experience with Python or development environments, it‚Äôs preferable to use the compiled standalone **Windows Installer** available [here](https://github.com/SidahmedKhettab/error-analyzer/releases/latest/download/Error-Analyzer-Setup.exe).  
> - On Linux or macOS, or if you‚Äôre an advanced Windows user, follow the steps below to build from source. These instructions are intended for users who are comfortable working with code.
